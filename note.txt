== Empty mansion ==
The empty mansion is used after King Boo has been portrificationized, to make sure nobody is in the mansion when resetting. It has no rooms, no data and no functions other than "generating" (which is actually wiping out the existing mansion).
It is loaded in when you enter the curved hallway with Mario's painting, but the data variables are set only when Mario has been unportrificationized.

== Predefined mansions ==
Add-on is the variable defined as loaded, namespace is the namespace used for files.
The following mansion types and mansion indexes are predefined, keep them in mind when making your add-ons.

mansion  | type | index | add-on       | overwrites     | namespace                 | Data pack name
empty    | -1   | -1    | vanilla      |                | -                         | "file/Luigi's Mansion"
normal   | 0    | 0     | vanilla      |                | luigis_mansion            | "file/Luigi's Mansion"
hidden   | 1    | 0     | vanilla      |                | luigis_mansion            | "file/Luigi's Mansion"
hidden   | 1    | 1     | 3ds_remake   | vanilla/hidden | luigis_mansion_3ds_remake | "file/Luigi's Mansion 3DS Remake"
??????   | ?    | ?     | vanilla      |                | luigis_mansion            | "file/Luigi's Mansion"
original | ?    | ?     | beta_mansion |                | luigis_beta_mansion       | "file/Luigi's Beta Mansion"

== Mansion data variables ==
To define a new mansion, you need to set the mansion_type value, mansion_data_index is for saved data, all mansions with the same data index use the same save data.

#mansion_type (int): Defines the mansion that is loaded.
#mansion_data_index (int): Defines the save data ID that is used.
#mirrored (bool): Whether the ghosts mirror all their animations.
#multiply_hurt (int): Multiplies base damage taken by this value where 100 = 1x.
#multiply_damage (int): Multiplies base damage dealt by this value where 100 = 1x.
#multiply_health (int): Multiplies enemy base health by this value where 100 = 1x.
#extra_health (int): Adds extra health to enemy max health where 100 = 1. (Added after multiplication. Example: base=10,multiply=150,extra=2000 -> 10*1.5+20 = 15+20 = 35)
#switch_boo_stats (bool): Whether the boos' base health and speed values are that of the original's hidden mansion.
#changing_max_health (bool): Whether players' max health can be changed by anything (and as such shows "/<MAX>" after the player's health) (if MaxHealth is changed and player is not hurt or healed, their current health doesn't change; they need to be hurt or healed, which will result in an update of health, afterwards it will make it the MaxHealth, is Health was above it)

None of these variables affect non-mansion rooms.

== Check compatibility/dependency ==
To set this add-on as loaded, allowing for other add-ons to check/warn for compatibility issues, add to the function tag #luigis_mansion:loaded_add_ons a function with the following contents: scoreboard players set #<add-on> Loaded 1
To check for add-on compatibility issues, add to the function tag #luigis_mansion:post_loaded_add_ons a function which checks if the other add-on is loaded (execute if score #<other add-on> Loaded matches 1 run ...) and send the mandatory commands.
You can also do the same, but for dependencies, eg if you need the 3ds_remake add-on to exist to have a functioning add-on. (execute unless score #<required add-on> Loaded matches 1 run ...)

== Other ==
Ghost behavioral change the 3ds remake add-on applies: Using a flashlight on a temper terror, flash or blue blaze make them "smug", laugh and then disappear, rather than ignore and continue moving/attacking.
Portrait ghosts drop pearls every health value which ends at a 0, except the max health, and 0 itself.
Portrait ghosts always drop 4 small pearls before dropping a medium pearl; the last possible small or medium pearl dropped is replaced with a big one if it had not dropped a pearl in any previous suction (eg if max health = 20, the only pearl will always be big; if max health was 500, the 48th one is big if the first didn't drop in a previous suction)
Room -4 is the gallery, regardless of 3ds remake add-on or not. The 3ds remake add-on will simply teleport players in the old gallery to the new one, and never start ticking the old one.
Negative Room values are reserved for non-mansion rooms and Room 0 the boo woods, all positive room scores can be used freely; the GBH map can have a range of "valid" rooms to open the map in
